NUMBERS - one of the datatypes in JavaScript it maybe a whole number or a decimal
There are two tyypes of numbers in JavaScript
Integer - Whole numbers
Float - Decimal Numbers

Value               Type (single quote or double quote is string)

5                   number(int)
3.14                number(float)
"12"                string
'3.1376'            string
6.54238             number(float)

//Converts String to Integer
let num = parseInt("5);

//Converts String to Decimal
let pi = parseFloat("3.14");

*Unsuccessful conversions will result into a NaN (Not A Number) Value

//Converting String to Integer Example

let num1 = "12";
let num2 = 2;

alert(parseInt(num1) + num2);

Result will show 14 insted of 122

//You can also do 

let num1 = "12";
let num2 = 2;

num1 = parseInt(num1);

alert(num1 + num2);


//If it has letters it will result to NaN (Not A Number)

let num1 = "asdsad12";
let num2 = 2;

num1 = parseInt(num1);

alert(num1 + num2);


//If the words is in the middle it will find the first number so the result will be 3 because of 1+2 = 3
let num1 = "1dasdad2";
let num2 = 2;

num1 = parseInt(num1);

alert(num1 + num2);

// This example will not add because parseInt is always round down so the result will be 15

let num1 = "15.53";
num1 = parseInt(num1);
alert(num1);


// So with these code it will be 16
let num1 = "15.99";
let num2 = 0.01;

num1 = parseFloat(num1);
alert(num1 + num2);


// With these code it will result to 15.990.01 because its a string

let num1 = "15.99";
let num2 = 0.01;

alert(num1 + num2);


// Parsing in this line of code would only result to 5 a whole number because as long as it is 0 it will still result to the number unless you add 1

let num1 = parseFloat(5.00);
alert(num1);

// If adding a different number other than 0 like this example this would result to 5.001

let num1 = parseFloat(5.001);
alert(num1);

IMPORTANT (USE ONLY parse if the value is a string)
//Example

let num1 = 5.001;
alert(num1);


//Assignment Operator

Operator            Function               Example
=                   Assignment             let num = 12


//Arithmetic Operators

Operator            Function               Example
+                   Addition                5 + 5
-                   Subtraction             5 - 5
*                   Multiplication          5 * 5
/                   Divsion                 5 / 5
**                  Exponent                5 ** 2
%                   Modulus (Remainder)     5 % 2

Operators can be applied to variables as well

//Arithmetic Precedence
PEMDAS is followed in the order of Precedence
1. Parenthesis
2. Exponent
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Addition
6. Subtraction

//Example the total would be 3 because 5 + 10 = 15 and x is 5 so 15 / 5 is 3 so total is 3

let x = 5;
let y = 10;
console.log((x + y)/x);

//Example (use PEMDAS) first divide x and y so x is 12 and y is 3 12 / 3 is equal to 4 and 4 plus x which is 12 is total to 16
let x = 12;
let y = 3;

console.log(x/y+x);


//Arithmetic Examples
let x = 5;
let y = 2;

//Multiplication
alert(x * y);

//Division
alert(x / y);

//Modulus
alert(x % y);

//Exponent
alert(x ** y);

//Addition
alert(x + y);

//Subtraction
alert(x - y);


// Another Example
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 2;
let num3 = 7;

alert((num1 - num3) + num2 ** num2);
//5 - 7 = -2 
// 2 ** 2 = 4
// -2 + 4 = 2             so 2 is the answer


//Shorthand Operators
Performs an Arithmetic operator to a variable and assigns to itself

Operator            Usage               Same as
+=                  x += 5              x = x + 5
-=                  x -= 5              x = x - 5
*=                  x *= 5              x = x * 5
/=                  x /= 5              x = x / 5
**=                 x **= 5             x = x ** 5
%=                  x %= 5              x = x % 5

//Example Shorthand Operators
let num = 5

num += 5;
alert(num)

logic num is 5 so num which is 5 + 5 is equals to 10

//Same logic as this below this is also equals to 10
let num = 5
num = num + 5;

alert(num);

//Another Example would be like this you can assign a different variable
let num = 5
let x = 2

num += x;

alert(num);

//Another Example the answer would be 9

let num = 5
let x = 2

num += (x ** 2);

alert(num);

//Another Example
let num = 5

num **= 5;
alert(num)

logic 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 3125


//Increment  / Decrement
Adds / Subtracts 1 to a variable
