//NOT OPERATOR
//INVERTS the result of a CONDITION

let hasDegree = true;
let experience = 3;

console.log(!hasDegree);
//Output: false
//Explanation: The value of hasDegree is true, but the NOT operator inverts the result of the condition, so the output is false.

console.log(!(experience > 1));
//Output: false
//Explanation: The value of experience is 3, and the condition is true, but the NOT operator inverts the result of the condition, so the output is false.
