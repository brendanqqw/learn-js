JSON & FOR/IN LOOP
We can use FOR/IN Loop to Iterate over all the keys inside a JSON.

// IN 
let person = {
  firstName: "Brendan",
  lastName: "Degrano",
  age: 22,
};
for (let i in person) {
  //Explaination: This is a for-in loop that iterates through the properties of the person object
  console.log(`${i}: ${person[i]}`);
}

//Output:
// firstName: Brendan
// lastName: Degrano
// age: 22

//Object.keys() Method
Returns the keys of JSON in an array format.
let person = {
  firstName: "Brendan",
  lastName: "Degrano",
  age: 22,
};

let keys = Object.keys(person); //Object.keys() is a method that returns an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop.
console.log(keys); //Explanation: This will return an array of the keys in the object person.

//Output: 
// [ 'firstName', 'lastName', 'age' ]



//ANOTHER EXAMPLE FOR 

let person = {
  firstName: "Brendan",
  lastName: "Degrano",
  age: 22,
};

let keys = Object.keys(person);
for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
  console.log(person[keys[i]]);
}


//EXAMPLE TO GET THE length
let person = {
  firstName: "Brendan",
  lastName: "Degrano",
  age: 22,
};

let size = Object.keys(person).length; //Explanation: Object.keys() returns an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. We can use it to get the length of an object. In this case, we are getting the length of the person object.
console.log(size);  //Output: 3
