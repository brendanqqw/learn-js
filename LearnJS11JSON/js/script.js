let person = {

console.log(person["hobbies"][0]); //Explanation: We can access the array elements using the index number. In this case, the index number is 0. So, it will print "Coding" in the console.
console.log(person.hobbies[1]); //Explanation: We can also access the array elements using the dot notation. In this case, the index number is 1. So, it will print "Eating" in the console.
