  hobbies: ["coding", "eating", "sleeping"],
};

console.log(person);


//A JSON can also have JSONs as its value

let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 25,
  hobbies: ["coding", "eating", "sleeping"],
  pets: {
    0: {
      name: "Rex",
      type: "Dog",
      breed: "German Shepherd",
    },
    1: {
      name: "Fluffy",
      type: "Cat",
      breed: "Siamese",
    },
  },
};

console.log(person);


//JSON Read
You can READ specific values of a JSON by using its key surrounded by []

let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 25,
};

console.log(person["firstName"]);
console.log(person["lastName"]);



//You can also READ specific values of a JSON by using a persion followed by the key
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 25,
};

let person = {

//Only Works on a "String" Key
console.log(`${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`);
//Output: John Doe
