WHILE Loop
is used to execute a block of code, while the condition is met/true.

let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++; //Why i++? It's because if we don't increment i, the loop will run forever.
}

// Output:  0
//          1
//          2
//          3
//          4


ITERATE Array
You can use while loop to read through all the array elements.

let people = ["David", "Alenere", "Gibert", "James"]; //array of people
let i = 0; //index

while(people[i]){ //while there is a person in the array
    console.log(people[i]); //print the person
    i++; //increment the index
}

//output: David
//        Alenere
//        Gibert
//        James


//ANOTHER EXAMPLE ITERATE Array 
let people = ["David", "Alenere", "Gibert", "James"]; //array of people
let i = people.length-1; //index of the last person in the array

while(people[i]){ //while there is a person in the array
    console.log(people[i]); //print the person
    i--; //decrement the index 
}


//BREAK Keyword
You can use the break keyword to break out of a loop earlier than expected.

let people = ["David", "Alenere", "Gibert", "James"]; //array of people
let i = 0; //index of the array

while(people[i]){
    console.log(people[i]); //print the people in the array
    i++; //increment the index
 //while loop

  if(i === 1){ //if the index is 1
    break; //break the loop when the index is 1
  }
}

//output: David


//ANOTHER EXAMPLE BREAK Keyword
let people = ["David", "Alenere", "Gibert", "James"]; //array of people
let i = 0; //index of the array

while(people[i]){
    console.log(people[i]); //print the people in the array
    i++; //increment the index
 //while loop

  if(i === 2){ //if the index is 2
    break; //break the loop
  }
}

//output: David
//        Alenere
