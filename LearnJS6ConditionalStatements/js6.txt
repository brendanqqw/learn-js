Conditional Statements
- Are statements that executs actions depending on
different conditions.
- They are used with Comparison Operators and Logical Operators.

Comparison Operators
Are operators used to compare 2 values.

Operator                    Description

==                          Equal
===                         Equal Value and Type
!=                          Not Equal
!==                         Not Equal Value and Type

----- Always outputs true or false (only bolean) -------

console.log(5 == "5");
//Explanation is 5 equal to 5 answer: true
//Output: true

console.log(5 === "5");
//Explanation is 5 straight equal to 5? the answer is false because 5 is not a number its a string so the answer is false
//Output: false

console.log(5 != "5");
//Explanation is 5 not equal to 5? the answer is false because 5 is equal to 5
//Output: false

console.log(5 !== "5");
//Explanation is 5 not straight equal to 5? the answer is true because 5 is not a number its a string so the answer is true
//Output: true

let x = 5;
console.log(x == "5");
//Explanation is x which is 5 equal to 5? answer: true
//Output: true

console.log(x === "5");
//Explanation is x which is 5 straight equal to 5? the answer is false because 5 is not a number its a string so the answer is false
//Output: false

console.log(x != "5");
//Explanation is x which is 5 not equal to 5? the answer is false because 5 is equal to 5
//Output: false

console.log(x !== "5");
//Explanation is x which is 5 not straight equal to 5? the answer is true because 5 is not a number its a string so the answer is true
//Output: true


//Another Example
let x = 10;
let y = 12;

alert(x == y);
//Output: false

//Another Example
let x = "Hello World";
let y = "hello world";

alert(x === y);
//Output: False
//Explanation: because of case sensitivity


//COMPARISON Operators
Operators used to compare 2 values.

Operator                    Description

>                           Greater Than
<                           Less Than
>=                          Greater Than or Equal
<=                          Less Than or Equal

*Always outputs true or false*

//Example

console.log(13 > 10);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 13 is greater than 10, so the output is true.

console.log(5 < 10);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 5 is less than 10, so the output is true.

console.log(5 >= 5);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 5 is greater than or equal to 5, so the output is true.

console.log(5 <= 7);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 5 is less than or equal to 7, so the output is true.

console.log(10 > 10);
//Output: false
//Explanation: 10 is not greater than 10, so the output is false.

console.log(10 < 10);
//Output: false
//Explanation: 10 is not less than 10, so the output is false.

console.log(10 >= 10);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 10 is greater than or equal to 10, so the output is true.

console.log(10 <= 10);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 10 is less than or equal to 10, so the output is true.
