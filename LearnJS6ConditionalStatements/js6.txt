Conditional Statements
- Are statements that executs actions depending on
different conditions.
- They are used with Comparison Operators and Logical Operators.

Comparison Operators
Are operators used to compare 2 values.

Operator                    Description

==                          Equal
===                         Equal Value and Type
!=                          Not Equal
!==                         Not Equal Value and Type

----- Always outputs true or false (only bolean) -------

console.log(5 == "5");
//Explanation is 5 equal to 5 answer: true
//Output: true

console.log(5 === "5");
//Explanation is 5 straight equal to 5? the answer is false because 5 is not a number its a string so the answer is false
//Output: false

console.log(5 != "5");
//Explanation is 5 not equal to 5? the answer is false because 5 is equal to 5
//Output: false

console.log(5 !== "5");
//Explanation is 5 not straight equal to 5? the answer is true because 5 is not a number its a string so the answer is true
//Output: true

let x = 5;
console.log(x == "5");
//Explanation is x which is 5 equal to 5? answer: true
//Output: true

console.log(x === "5");
//Explanation is x which is 5 straight equal to 5? the answer is false because 5 is not a number its a string so the answer is false
//Output: false

console.log(x != "5");
//Explanation is x which is 5 not equal to 5? the answer is false because 5 is equal to 5
//Output: false

console.log(x !== "5");
//Explanation is x which is 5 not straight equal to 5? the answer is true because 5 is not a number its a string so the answer is true
//Output: true


//Another Example
let x = 10;
let y = 12;

alert(x == y);
//Output: false

//Another Example
let x = "Hello World";
let y = "hello world";

alert(x === y);
//Output: False
//Explanation: because of case sensitivity


//COMPARISON Operators
Operators used to compare 2 values.

Operator                    Description

>                           Greater Than
<                           Less Than
>=                          Greater Than or Equal
<=                          Less Than or Equal

*Always outputs true or false*

//Example

console.log(13 > 10);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 13 is greater than 10, so the output is true.

console.log(5 < 10);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 5 is less than 10, so the output is true.

console.log(5 >= 5);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 5 is greater than or equal to 5, so the output is true.

console.log(5 <= 7);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 5 is less than or equal to 7, so the output is true.

console.log(10 > 10);
//Output: false
//Explanation: 10 is not greater than 10, so the output is false.

console.log(10 < 10);
//Output: false
//Explanation: 10 is not less than 10, so the output is false.

console.log(10 >= 10);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 10 is greater than or equal to 10, so the output is true.

console.log(10 <= 10);
//Output: true
//Explanation: 10 is less than or equal to 10, so the output is true.


//Another Example
let x = 12;
let y = 15;

alert(x > y);
// Output: false
// Explanation: The value of x is 12 and the value of y is "15". The greater than operator (>) compares the values of x and y. Since the value of x is less than the value of y, the output is false.

alert(x < y);
// Output: true
// Explanation: The value of x is 12 and the value of y is "15". The less than operator (<) compares the values of x and y. Since the value of x is less than the value of y, the output is true.

alert(x >= y);
// Output: false
// Explanation: The value of x is 12 and the value of y is "15". The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of x and y. Since the value of x is less than the value of y, the output is false.

alert(x <= y);
// Output: true
// Explanation: The value of x is 12 and the value of y is "15". The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of x and y. Since the value of x is less than the value of y, the output is true.


//IF Statement
Uses the IF keyword and {} to check for a certain conditions

let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("Legal Age");
}

console.log("Thank You!");

//Output: Legal Age
//        Thank You!

//Explanation: The if statement checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18. Since the age is 18, the condition is true and the code inside the if block is executed. The console.log("Legal Age") statement is executed. After the if block, the console.log("Thank You!") statement is executed.


//ELESE Statement
let age = 13;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("Legal Age");
  console.log("You are allowed to drink alcohol");
} else {
  console.log("Underage");
}

console.log("Thank You!");

//Output : Underage
//         Thank You!
//Explanation : The value of age is 13. The condition age >= 18 is false. So, the else block is executed. The output is Underage and Thank You!.


//ELSE IF Statement
Uses the ELSE IF keyword and {} it is used in combination with the IF keyword if
you want additinal specific conditions. You can add as many as you want.

let age = 11;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("Legal Age");
} else if (age <= 0) {
  console.log("Invalid Age");
} else {
  console.log("Minor Age");
}

console.log("Tnak you!");

//Output: Invalid Age
//        Tnak you!


*ELSE IF runs sequentially when the IF comparison is false*
