let x = 15;
let y = 15;

alert(x > y);
// Output: false
// Explanation: The value of x is 12 and the value of y is "15". The greater than operator (>) compares the values of x and y. Since the value of x is less than the value of y, the output is false.

alert(x < y);
// Output: true
// Explanation: The value of x is 12 and the value of y is "15". The less than operator (<) compares the values of x and y. Since the value of x is less than the value of y, the output is true.

alert(x >= y);
// Output: false
// Explanation: The value of x is 12 and the value of y is "15". The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of x and y. Since the value of x is less than the value of y, the output is false.

alert(x <= y);
// Output: true
// Explanation: The value of x is 12 and the value of y is "15". The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of x and y. Since the value of x is less than the value of y, the output is true.
