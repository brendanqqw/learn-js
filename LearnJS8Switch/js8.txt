SWITCH Statement
Are used to execute code depending on a case. It acts like Conditional Statements
but can only check equality

//Example
let difficulty = 3;

switch (difficulty) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Easy");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Normal");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Hard");
    break;
}

//BREAK Keyword
break; is necessary after a case since it will let the program
break out of the switch statement.

Without it, the switch statement will continue running all coed blocks.


// DEFAULT Keyword
Default is used to handle all cases that weren't specified.
